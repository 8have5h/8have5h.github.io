# My First Blog Post

Hello! This is a sample blog post written in Markdown.

## Why Blogging?

I decided to add this section to share more in-depth thoughts on projects, concepts I'm learning, or experiences in tech.

## Tech Stack

This portfolio uses:
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- `react-markdown` for this blog!

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet('World');
```
Stay tuned for more posts!
